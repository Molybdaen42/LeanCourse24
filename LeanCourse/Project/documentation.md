**Main results**
First, we implemented the origami constructible numbers and proved some basic lemmata. Then, we showed that they form a subfield of the complex numbers. After that there are proofs for 𝕆 being closed under taking square and cube roots. All proofs are complete.

**Sources**
The definition of lines and 𝕆 is inspired by
*https://github.com/Louis-Le-Grand/Formalisation-of-constructable-numbers*.
The proofs, some lemmata and the definition of 𝕆 are taken from a paper which is added to the repository.
